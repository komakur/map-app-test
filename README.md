# map_app_test

## App  that shows users current location on a map

### In the test task I have implemented:
 
1. Registration with Google and providing email and password;
2. The Google Maps is real time changing (it listens to any location changes and to any changes in the Firestore);
3. Clicking on users markers provide short info about user accociated with the marker;
4. In the left center side of a MapScreen lays out a button which navigates to a authorised user info (here the user can ***log out***);
5. The FloatingButton serves as a navigator to the user current position on a Google Maps;
